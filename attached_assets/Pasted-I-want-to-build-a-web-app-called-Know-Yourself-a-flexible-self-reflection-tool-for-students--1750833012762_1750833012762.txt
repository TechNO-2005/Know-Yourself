I want to build a web app called **"Know Yourself"** — a flexible self-reflection tool for students and young individuals inspired by Ivy League college essay prompts.

---

### 📌 What the app does:

The user is guided through a set of deep, introspective questions (1 per page). They can answer as many as they wish and return to their responses anytime. All data — including reflections, AI insights, and personal realizations — is securely stored under their account. At any point, they can trigger a Gemini-powered AI analysis that generates clear, critical insights into their reflections. Finally, the user adds their own summary of what they learned.

---

### 🔐 Authentication (Feature 1):

* Users must **sign up or log in** with username and password
* Store login data securely in a `users` database
* Each user has a unique ID linking to their answers and analysis

---

### 🧭 Navigation:

* **Breadcrumbs** shown at the top of each page for orientation
* Each question on a dedicated page
* Users can go back and forth freely

---

### ✍️ Reflection Questions (Feature 2):

* Each question has:

  * A core prompt
  * A brief guide on what to reflect on
  * A large text input box
  * Options: **Save & Next**, **Trigger AI Analysis Now**
  * Auto-save enabled (answers update in real-time)
  * Responses can be edited at any time

#### 🔟 Themes and Their Questions:

1. **Identity / Roots**
   *Describe a background, interest, or talent that has deeply shaped who you are today. Why is it significant to you?*
   *Reflect on something that’s been with you for a long time — a family tradition, a personal passion, or an experience that defines your roots. What role does it play in how you think or behave today?*

2. **Challenge / Failure**
   *Talk about a meaningful failure or challenge you’ve faced. What did it teach you about yourself?*
   *Don’t focus on the mistake itself, but how it changed your thinking. Show vulnerability, growth, and the lessons you wouldn’t have learned otherwise.*

3. **Questioning Beliefs**
   *Describe a time you seriously questioned a belief or assumption you once held. What changed inside you?*
   *Reflect on how you handled discomfort, confrontation, or change. What did the shift reveal about you?*

4. **Experiencing Gratitude**
   *Reflect on a person or moment that made you feel truly grateful. How did it shape your perspective or behavior?*
   *Go beyond just saying “thank you.” Explore why that moment/person mattered, what values it revealed in you, and how it still affects your actions.*

5. **Personal Growth**
   *What event or realization made you aware of something deep about yourself? How did it change how you live or think?*
   *Talk about a turning point — a time when you discovered a part of yourself you hadn’t fully seen before.*

6. **Passion / Flow**
   *Describe an activity or topic that completely absorbs you — something you do where time disappears. What do you think this says about who you are?*
   *What lights you up? What kind of problems do you enjoy solving?*

7. **Community / Belonging**
   *Talk about a community or group you feel strongly connected to. What role does it play in your life?*
   *How have you contributed or been shaped by others? What does belonging mean to you?*

8. **Ethical Courage**
   *Describe a time you stood up for someone or something important, even when it was difficult. What did you learn about your inner strength?*
   *Reflect on fear, doubt, and what gave you the courage to act anyway.*

9. **Influences**
   *Who has had a significant influence on how you think or live? What’s the most important lesson they taught you?*
   *Pick someone real. What did their presence reveal about you?*

10. **Open / Creative Self**
    *What’s something unusual, surprising, or creative that really matters to you — and what does it reveal about your personality?*
    *Think about a strange obsession, talent, or worldview you have. What makes it yours, and why do you treasure it?*

### 🤖 AI Analysis (Feature 3):

* AI analysis can be requested after any question or after all answers
* Powered by **Gemini API**
* The prompt sent to Gemini:

```text
Provide a crisp and critical analysis of all the answers to the questions on self-reflection by the user using all psychological principles. It is not going to be a gospel truth, rather an AI-based interpretation.
```

* Gemini returns:

  * A list of **7–10 psychological self-discoveries** (clear bullet points)
  * **No paragraph**, just sharp, accurate observations
* AI response is shown on a results page and saved in the database

---

### 📘 Final Step – What the User Learned (Feature 4):

* Prompt:

  > "Write anything you personally learned about yourself from this experience. There’s no limit. Reflect freely."
* Stored as part of user’s data, editable anytime

---

### 🗃️ Database Schema:

* `users`: user\_id, username, password\_hash, created\_at
* `reflections`: user\_id, question\_id, question\_text, user\_response, updated\_at
* `analysis`: user\_id, self\_discoveries (array), analysis\_timestamp
* `final_learnings`: user\_id, self\_written\_learnings (text), submitted\_at

---

### ✅ App Stack Notes:

* Built with **React + Supabase** (or Firebase alternative)
* Backend calls Gemini API securely
* Breadcrumbs enable smooth navigation
* Auto-save while typing, and responses remain editable

### 🪩 Homepage Quote:

> **"Reflection without action becomes illusion. Learn, then move forward."**

(This is to gently remind users that self-awareness should serve growth, not stall it.)
